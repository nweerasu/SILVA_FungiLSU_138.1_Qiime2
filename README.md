SILVA_FungiLSU_138.1_Qiime2
Curated SILVA 138.1 release Fungal LSU fasta and taxonomy files compatible with feature-classifier in Qiime2

LSURef Silva files, release 138.1, were downloaded from: https://www.arb-silva.de/fileadmin/silva_databases/release_138.1/Exports/SILVA_138.1_LSURef_tax_silva.fasta.gz

Files were then modified to fit fasta and taxonomy templates used for Qiime2 feature-classifier (see:https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.8/tutorials/feature-classifier/ tutorial files for format information). SILVA reference sequences are being phylogenetically checked for accuracy (ongoing) using MycoBank.
